Hi, I’m @LandSharkFive,

I’m interested in B+ Trees, Skip Lists and LSM Trees.  I'm a strong database designer, performance tuner and API engineer.

I’m currently learning Angular and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  I have several libraries of DSA code.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on skip lists for external storage.  My best idea is to allow overlapping keys and values.
And then provide a background process to go back and fix the overlapping keys and values, by merging, sorting and splitting
them.  I'm working on skip lists for external storage slowly.  Doing Proof of Concepts on individual ideas.  And then
doing performance testing.

📫 How to reach me email.  Apologies, I'm busy and hard to reach.  No haters or spammers please.
